Shrtn is a simple URL shortner that I wanted to build to test out the capabilities of Next 13 and its app dir changes.

To run the project locally you will need a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to a supabase database instance. From there you can run a `prisma db push` to prepare your instance with the expected layout.

To run the client use `npm run dev`
